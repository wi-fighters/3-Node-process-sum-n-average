# Sum N' Average

Create a program that takes in an operation to perform ("sum" / "avg"), and a set of numbers as arguments. The program should print out the result of the calculation to the terminal.

**Constraints**:

- The first argument can only either be the string `sum` or the string `avg`. In case it is not, the program should exit and print the following message: "I cannot calculate that, please type either Sum (sum) or Average (avg)"

- Any following arguments must be numbers. In case one of the is not a number, the program should exit and print the following message: "Sorry, but one of the arguments you passed, is not a number, please try again".
